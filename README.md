# NLP Resume Classification üìÑüîç

## Overview
Welcome to the **NLP-Resume-Classification** repository! This project focuses on leveraging advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to accurately classify resume categories with high precision and recall. It includes a Streamlit interface for seamless resume uploads and predictions. The model is robust and built to handle edge cases such as invalid inputs and out-of-dataset values.

## Project Details
This project combines the power of logistic regression, machine learning, NLP, and other related technologies to create an efficient resume categorization system. The use of the NLTK library, SMOTE technique, and Streamlit interface makes the entire process smooth and user-friendly.

## Features
- **Logistic Regression**: The classification model utilizes logistic regression for its efficiency and effectiveness in handling binary classification tasks.
- **NLP Techniques**: Natural Language Processing techniques are employed to preprocess, tokenize, and analyze resume text data.
- **Streamlit Interface**: The Streamlit interface allows users to easily upload resumes and receive accurate predictions on the resume category.
- **Handle Edge Cases**: The system is designed to handle edge cases like invalid inputs and out-of-dataset values gracefully.
